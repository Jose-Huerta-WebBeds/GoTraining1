# GoTraining1
I tried to create an organized folder structure... maybe a bit overengineered. 

Currently presenting a counter at /counter
Serving at port 8090
Typical call http://localhost:8090/counter

Missing:
* Control the limit of calls
* Stress test
* Integration test (Calling the server end-end)
